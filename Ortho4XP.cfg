# Directory location (ADAPT to your settings !!!)
##################################################

# I : To use the build overlay function 
# Should be a level of directory just above Earth nav data
# and without trailing slash.
# For example, on Linux/Mac (remove the next # if applicable)
# default_sniff_dir = '/home/oscarpilote/XP10/Custom Scenery/zzz_HD_v3'
# or on Windows (remove the next # if applicable)
# default_sniff_dir = 'C:\\X-Plane-10\\Custom Scenery\\zzz_HD_v3'


# II : The interface "Earth tile map" with right-clic allows you to add/remove 
# symbolic link to tiles in your Custom Scenery dir. 
# For that you need to tell me where it is located !
# For example under windows(remove the next # if applicable)
#Custom_scenery_dir="C:\\X-Plane-10\\Custom Scenery"
#or on Linux/Mac (remove the next # if applicable)
#Custom_scenery_dir="/media/oscarpilote/X-Plane-ssd/X-Plane-10/Custom Scenery"

# III : if you still wish to rely on gimp for masks (no longer required) otherwise leave as is
use_gimp=False
# use_gimp=True
# If so then indicate its path
# The next could be a good bet for Windows
#gimp_cmd="c:\\Program Files\\GIMP 2\\bin\\gimp-console-2.8.exe "
#This one for OS X
#gimp_cmd="/Applications/GIMP.app/Contents/MacOS/GIMP " 
#And that one for Linux
#gimp_cmd="gimp "
